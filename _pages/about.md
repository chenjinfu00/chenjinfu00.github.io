I am Jinfu Chen. I was born in Mianyang, Sichuan, China on April 20, 1994. During high school, I appreciated a lot how physics describes the world with precise mathematic formulas, which motivated me to study for a B.S. in Physics and a double degree in Mathematics at Peking University (PKU) starting in 2012.

After my bachelor’s graduation in 2016, I joined Prof. [C. P. Sun’s group](http://suncp.gscaep.ac.cn) at the Beijing Computational Science Research Center (CSRC), China Academy of Engineering Physics (CAEP), where I pursued a Ph.D. in quantum physics under his supervision. My research focused on quantum thermodynamics, to understand thermodynamics and statistical physics exploiting quantum mechanics. We developed thermodynamic geometry for optimizing the control of quantum systems, e.g., improving the performance of quantum heat engines as an application.

I completed my Ph.D. in 2021 and then returned to PKU, becoming a postdoc in Prof. [H. T. Quan’s group](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=de&user=PTULG-sAAAAJ). We focused on mesoscopic quantum and classical systems (e.g., quantum dots and Brownian particles). We studied fluctuation theorems and control optimization with large derivation theory and optimal control theory, respectively.

In February 2024, I joined Leiden University (LU) as a postdoctoral researcher in Prof. [Jordi Tura’s group](https://jtura.cat). My research focuses on the intersection of quantum thermodynamics and many-body systems. Since “more is different”, this intersection will bring substantial opportunities for both fields, potentially leading to a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics and effective control methods for many-body systems.


The following is a Fugue of thermodynamics, which is still under composing!

Learn thermodynamics and equilibrium statistical physics in five minutes!

Always consider equilibrium states $p(c)=e^{-\beta E(c)}/Z(\beta)$. The internal energy is $U=\sum_{c} E(c) p(c)$. Here $c$ is the configuration, for example, the states of spins in Ising model.

Define work and heat as $\delta W=\delta\lambda\sum_{c}\frac{\partial p_{\beta}(c)}{\partial\lambda}$ and $\delta Q=\delta U-\delta W$

First law and second law of thermodynamics in ensemble average

Thermodynamics process: Quasistatic isothermal processes: The system have sufficient time to relax to equilibrium states at each $\lambda$

Thermodynamic adiabatic processes: No energy exchange between system and environment

**There is no equation of motion, and only equilibrium states can be studied.**
